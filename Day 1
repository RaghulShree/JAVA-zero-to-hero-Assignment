Compiler: 
It is a translator which takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language. 

A compiler is more intelligent than an assembler it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, etc.

But its program run time is more and occupies a larger part of memory. It has slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.

Interpreter: 
An interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. –  

It translates only one statement of the program at a time.

Interpreters, more often than not are smaller than compilers.
